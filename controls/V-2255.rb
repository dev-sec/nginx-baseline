Benchmark: APACHE SERVER 2.2 for Unix  
Status: Accepted 

All directives specified in this STIG must be specifically set (i.e. the
server is not allowed to revert to programmed defaults for these directives).
Included files should be reviewed if they are used. Procedures for reviewing
included files are included in the overview document. The use of .htaccess
files are not authorized for use according to the STIG. However, if they are
used, there are procedures for reviewing them in the overview document. The
Web Policy STIG should be used in addition to the Apache Site and Server STIGs
in order to do a comprehensive web server review.

  desc "In addition to OS restrictions, access rights to files and directories
  can be set on a web site using the web server software.That is, in addition
  to allowing or denying all access rights, a rule can be specified that
  allows or denies partial access rights.For example, users can be given read-
  only access rights to files, to view the information but not change the
  files.

  This check verifies that the htpasswd file is only accessible by system
  administrators or web managers, with the account running the web service
  having group permissions of read and execute.  htpasswd is a utility used to
  provide for password access to web sites."
